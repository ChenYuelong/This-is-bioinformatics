A spreadsheet will often accompany each column to demonstrate the calculations (Supplementary Table 1). We will not exhaust you with mathematics. Statistics can be broadly divided into two categories: descriptive and\r\ninferential. The first summarizes the main features of a data set with measures such as the mean and standard deviation (s.d.). The second generalizes from observed data to the world at large.

Instead, repeated measurements span a range of val- ues because of biological variability and precision limits of measuring equipment. But if results are different each time, how do we determine whether a measurement is compatible with our hypothesis? In “the great tragedy of Science—the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact”1, how is ‘ugliness’ measured? Statistics helps us answer this question. It gives us a way to quanti-\r\ntatively model the role of chance in our experiments and to represent data not as precise measurements but as estimates with error. It also tells us how error in input values propagates through calculations. The practical application of this theoretical framework is to associate uncertainty to the outcome of experiments and to assign confidence levels to statements that generalize beyond observations. Although many fundamental concepts in statistics can be under-\r\nstood intuitively, as natural pattern-seekers we must recognize the limits of our intuition when thinking about chance and probability. The Monty Hall problem is a classic example of how the wrong answer can appear far too quickly and too credibly before our eyes. A contestant is given a choice of three doors, only one leading to a prize. After selecting a door (e.g., door 1), the host opens one of the other two doors that does not lead to a prize (e.g., door 2) and gives the contestant the option to switch their pick of doors (e.g., door 3). The vexing question is whether it is in the contestant’s best interest to switch. The answer is yes, but you would be in good company if you thought otherwise. When a solution was published in Parade magazine, thousands of readers (many with PhDs) wrote in that the answer was wrong2. Comments varied from “You made a mistake, but look at the positive side. If all those PhDs were wrong, the country would be in some very serious trouble” to “I must admit I doubted you until my fifth grade math class proved you right”2."]],[139,139],[2122,2122]]],[1521184803960,["yuelong.chen@EIBJDE0195",[[-1,140," "],[-1,581,"\r"],[-1,139,".\r"]],[141,141],[139,139]]],[1521184944641,[null,[[-1,139,"."],[-1,580,"Instead, repeated measurements span a range of val- ues because of biological variability and precision limits of measuring equipment.
